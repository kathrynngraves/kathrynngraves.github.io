		<p> Call me Kat! </p>
      <p>I'm a fifth year Cognitive Neuroscience PhD candidate in the Turk-Browne Lab at Yale University. I am largely interested in the ways in which people learn and extract 
	      structure from their environments as they navigate, and the neural mechanisms that support these processes. In other words, I have people run 
	      around in virtual environments and even in the real world, while I observe their behavior and record from their brains! More specifically, I use a 
	      combination of behavioral, computational, and intracranial EEG methods to investigate the complex capacity that is human navigation.</p>

    		<p>Prior to graduate school, I was a graduate Research Assistant in the Thompson-Schill Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, before which I 
			was an undergrad RA in the Badre Lab at Brown University.</p>
		    		
		<p>Beyond the lab, I am committed to the fight for black liberation and equity for underrepresented minorities in STEM.</p>
