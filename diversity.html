		<h1 style="font-size:22px; color:#FA4B85" align="left">Yale Psychology Bootcamp</h1>
		<p><b>I am currently a co-chair of the Yale Psychology Department Committee on Diversity and Inclusion, which aims to create a diverse and inclusive environment both for our faculty, students, and staff, and for the STEM community more broadly. We meet regularly to discuss how the department can actualize its commitment to diversity (including but not limited to issues of gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, and SES) in its members and culture and through its research, courses, and speakers. On June 30th, 2020, the committee partnered with the Yale Office of Graduate Student Development and Diversity to provide a 3 hour Psychology "boot camp" for over 400 primarily underrepresented minority undergraduate and post-graduate attendees. Video from the event, as well as resources for pursuing a career in psychology, are linked here.  </p>
